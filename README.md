RNN is a Recurrent Neural Network have proven to be one of the most powerful models fro processing sequential data. The Long Short Term Memory is one of the most successful RNN architecture. LSTM introduces the memory cell the unit of computation that replaces the traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer in network. This memory cells, networks are able to effectively associate memories and input remote in time. Hence they suit to grasp the structure of the data dynamically over time with high prediction capacity.
